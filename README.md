# Tomacio

It is a simple application for time tracking. As a software engineer working
remotely, I need a tool to control the time in my daily tasks. The objective
is to create an application that suits my needs, trying to be as lean as
possible and driving development with tests.

## Getting started

In order to start a development server, we must install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
and [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

1\. Run the next command for installing dependencies:
```bash
$ make install
```

2\. Start the development server:
```bash
$ make start
```

3\. Finally go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and enjoy!
